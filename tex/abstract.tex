Being able to simulate fluids in real time is important in many applications
including games and interactive visualizations. In this report we describe a
modern approach to modeling fluid behavior at interactive frame rates even on
mediocre hardware. This method is called Position-Based Dynamics and works by
enforcing certain constraints on a set of particles. We also present a method
for implementing Position-Based Dynamics on graphics hardware in order to take
advantage of the massively parallel architecture available and achieve the
desired performance. Finally we address some ways in which Position-Based
Dynamics can be used to simulate phenomena other than fluids.
