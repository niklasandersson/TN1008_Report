Being able to simulate fluids in real time is important in many applications
including games and interactive visualizations. In this report we describe a
modern approach to modeling fluid behavior at interactive frame rates even on
mediocre hardware. This method is called position-based dynamics and works by
enforcing certain constraints on a set of particles. We also present a method
for implementing position-based dynamics on graphics hardware in order to take
advantage of the massively parallel architecture available and achieve the
desired performance. Finally we address someways in which position-based
dynamics can be used to to simulate other phenomena than fluids.
