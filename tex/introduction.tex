Simulating the behavior of fluids is an intriguing topic that has grown into an
expansive field of research and development. This broad area is mainly divided
into two different categories of application for fluid simulations. The first
category deals with attempting to create a simulation that is as physically
correct as possible while the second is focusing on creating a simulation that
is visually pleasing but whose behavior might not be entirely accurate. In this
report we focus solely on the second category and discuss a method called
\textit{Position-Based Dynamics} (PBD) \cite{muller2007position} that is designed to be used in games and other real-time applications. Position-based dynamics is a
particle-based method which means that the behavior of the fluid is determined
by the movements of a large number of particles. This is not something that is
unique to Position-Based Dynamics by any means as it is in fact one of the most
common ways of doing fluid simulation. Another common method that is based on
particles is \textit{Smoothed-Particle Hydrodynamics} (SPH) \cite{monaghan1992smoothed}. What makes PBD unique is that it is based on a set of constraints directly affecting the positions of the particles making the system more stable than the traditional approach of applying forces to update the acceleration that will then have to be integrated twice before a new position can be derived.
