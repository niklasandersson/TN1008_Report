In order to achieve real time performance the simulation had to be implemented
for parallel execution on GPUs (Graphics Processing Unit). This is made
possible through a technique called GPGPU (General-Purpose computing on
Graphics Processing Units). To maximize the throughput of GPUs fine-grained
parallelism is required. The use of particles together with PBD enables a
choice of the level of parallelism for a certain task. I.e. calculations can
either be done per particle, per constraint or per grid cell if a uniform grid
is used. We are mostly using the per particle or a particle-centric perspective
when performing the calculations, however we also use a constraint-centric
view, e.g. for solving collision constraints, and the per cell view when
constructing the grid.
