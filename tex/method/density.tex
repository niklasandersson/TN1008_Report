The work flow for solving the density constraint is closely tied with the theory starting at Equation \ref{eq:Ci}.
To determine $\lambda_{i}$, the components in Equation \ref{eq:LambdaEpsilon} are calculated separately in parallel
for each particle \textit{i}.
The numerator is calculated by following Equation \ref{eq:Ci}, which is a sum of the smoothing kernel Poly6 over
all neighbours. The smoothing kernel has a width $h_{Poly6} = 4.1$ and the rest density parameter, $\rho$, is set to be $\rho = 1200$.
The denominator is a sum of the norm of the Spiky kernel calculated over all neighbours
and is then set to the power of 2. The kernel width $h_{Spiky} = 6.1$ for Spiky works well and the
relaxation parameter $\varepsilon$ is set to $\varepsilon = 0.0001$.

To extend the parallelization even more we rearrange and rewrite Equation \ref{eq:LambdaEpsilon} by including Equation \ref{eq:NablaC}. With the
new Equation \ref{eq:LambdaNew} we can observe that the difference between the sums is the norm of the gradient is applied
outside respectively inside of the sums:
\\
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:LambdaNew}
\lambda_i = \frac{- C_i(\hat{\mathbf{x}}) }{ |\sum\limits_{k} \nabla \mathbf{x}_k W|^{2} + \sum\limits_{j} |-\nabla \mathbf{x}_j W|^2  + \varepsilon}.
\end{equation}
\\
\newline
We then continue to follow the algorithm overview at Algorithm \ref{alg:overview}, line 16, where the next step is to estimate the new position $\Delta \mathbf{x}^{*}_{i}$.
The predicted position is defined at Equation \ref{eq:DeltaPscorr}, containing a sum of $s_{corr}$ , $\lambda_{i}$, $\lambda_{j}$
and \textit{Spiky} kernel over all neighbours.
The parameters of $s_{corr}$; k, n and $ \nabla \mathbf{q}$, are defined as $k = 0.2, n = 4, |\nabla \mathbf{q}| = 0.2$.
\\
At last, the total predicted position is updated and applied by adding the newly and previously estimated position,
as seen at line 20 at Algorithm \ref{alg:overview}.

\subsubsection{Vorticity and viscosity}
The steps to calculate the vorticity and viscosity are fully described from Equation \ref{eq:Omega} to Equation \ref{eq:Viscosity}.
A local estimation of the vorticity is initially calculated and defined as $\omega$. The complete vorticity force is then determined
by Equation \ref{eq:Viscosity}, where we use the force strength parameter as $\varepsilon = 1$. The force is then added to the total
external force that is affecting the particles at the beginning of the time step, as seen at line 2 at Algorithm \ref{alg:overview}.
\\
The new viscosity velocity is calculated by adding the old velocity with the sum of the smoothing kernel \textit{Poly6} multiplied by the velocity difference between
the current particle and its neighbours. The viscosity strength parameter, as seen in Equation \ref{eq:Viscosity}, is $c = 0.0001$.
