The workflow for solving the density constraint is closely tied with the theory starting at equation \ref{eq:Ci}. 
To determine $\lambda_{i}$, the components in equation \ref{eq:LambdaEpsilon} are calculated seperately in parallel 
for each particle \textit{i}.
The numerator is calculated by following equation \ref{eq:Ci}, which is a sum of the smoothing kernel \textit{Poly6} over 
all neighbours. The smoothing kernel has a width $h_{Poly6} = 4.1$ and the rest density parameter, $\rho$, is set to be $\rho = 1200$. 
The denominator is a sum of the norm of the \textit{Spiky} kernel calculated over all neighbours 
and is then set to the power of 2. The kernel width $h_{Spiky} = 6.1$ for \textit{Spiky} works well and the 
relaxation parameter $\varepsilon$ is set to $\varepsilon = 0.0001$. 
\\
To speed up the performance the sum included in \textit{Spiky} can be replaced by multiplying the donimator at equation
\ref{eq:LambdaEpsilon} with 2, since these two sums are equal.

We then continue to follow the algorithm overview at \ref{alg:overview}, where the next step is to estimate the new position $\Delta \mathbf{x}^{*}_{i}$.
The predicted position is defined at equation \ref{eq:DeltaPscorr}, containing a sum of $s_{corr}$ , $\lambda_{i}$, $\lambda_{j}$ 
and \textit{Spiky} kernel over all neighbours. 
The parameters of $s_{corr}$; k, n and $ \nabla \mathbf{q}$, are defined as $k = 0.2, n = 4, |\nabla \mathbf{q}| = 0.2$. 
\\
At last, the total predicted position is updated and applied by adding the newly and previously estimated position, 
as seen at line 20 at algorithm \ref{alg:overview}.
