In this secion we present the core concepts of PBD and
explain the theory involed in creating a fluid simulation.

\subsection{Density}

The estimation of the predicted position of the particles is initially based on
solving a density constraint $C$ at Equation $\ref{eq:Taylor}$. Where each
density constraint is applied per particle. The density constraint is a
function of the position of the current particle and the positions of its
neighbours within a fixed radius. For each particle \textit{i}, the applied
density constraint is defined as Equation \ref{eq:Ci}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Ci}
C_i(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{\rho_i}{\rho_0} - 1,
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{x}$ contains the positions of the neighbouring particles,
$\rho_0$ is the fluid's rest density and $\rho_i$ is estimated by the density
SPH estimator:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Rhoi}
\rho_i = \sum\limits_{j} w_j W(\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{x}_j, h).
\end{equation}

In this particular case, where all particles have equal mass, the mass
parameter $m_j$ can be removed from Equation $\ref{eq:Rhoi}$. What is left is a
sum of density kernels $W$, also called \textit{Poly6}, see
\cite{muller2003particle}. Where $W$ is a kernel function with the parameters;
the position of the current particle  $i$, neighboring positions $j$ and a
fixed radius $h$.

The next term to be solved from Equation $\ref{eq:Taylor}$ is $\nabla C$. It is
done by following the approach of \cite{macklin2013position} and has two different outcomes based on whenever particle $k$ is a neighbouring particle or not:

\begin{equation}
 \nabla \mathbf{x}_k C_i = \frac{1}{\rho_0}
  \begin{cases}
  \label{eq:NablaC}
  \displaystyle \sum\limits_{j} \nabla_{\mathbf{x}_k} W(\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{x}_j, h) & $\text{if }$ k = i \\
  - \nabla_{\mathbf{x}_k} W(\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{x}_j, h) & $\text{if }$ k = j \\
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

The definition of $ \nabla_{\mathbf{x}} W(\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{x}_j, h) $ is a
kernel called \textit{Spiky} that is, together with the \textit{Poly6}
kernel, defined and described in ~\cite{muller2003particle}.

As seen in $\cite{macklin2013position}$, we can observe that this is not stable
when the particles are at the boundary of the smoothing kernel, mainly because
of the denominator with the exponents in the kernel function.  Therefore a user
specified relaxation parameter, $\varepsilon$, is added to Equation $\ref{eq:Taylor}$ to add constraint force. The modified version of Equation $\ref{eq:lambdaallparticles}$ is given by

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:LambdaEpsilon}
\lambda_i = \frac{- C_i(\mathbf{x}) }{ \sum\limits_{k} |\nabla_{\mathbf{x}_k} C_i|^2 + \varepsilon}.
\end{equation}
We can now include $\lambda_j$ from the neighbouring particles in the
estimation of the final position update, $\Delta \mathbf{x}$, given by

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:DeltaP}
\Delta \mathbf{x}_i = \frac{1}{\rho_0} \sum\limits_{j} (\lambda_i + \lambda_j) \nabla W(\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{x}_j, h).
\end{equation}

\subsection{Tensile Instability} We continue to follow the theory in
\cite{macklin2013position} that describes different problems with particle clustering and coupling as a result of negative pressure. The trick is to force the pressure to be non-negative using an additional pressure term. This pressure
force is described as

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Scorr}
s_{corr} = -k \left( \frac{W(\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{x}_j, h)}{W(\Delta \mathbf{q}, h)} \right),
\end{equation}

where $\Delta \mathbf{q}$ is a point with a fixed distance from the current particle inside the kernel
radius and k is a small positive constant. This term is then included in
Equation $\ref{eq:DeltaP}$ and the final version is updated to

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:DeltaPscorr}
\Delta \mathbf{x} = \frac{1}{\rho_0} \sum\limits_{j} (\lambda_i + \lambda_j + s_{corr}) \nabla W(\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{x}_j, h).
\end{equation}

\subsection{Vorticity confinement and viscosity} In order to add turbulent
motion to the fluid we add a \textit{vorticity} term to the calculations, as
described in \cite{macklin2013position}. The vorticity is calculated by first
using the Spiky kernel function as following:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Omega}
\omega_{i} = \nabla \times \mathbf{v} =  \sum\limits_{j} \mathbf{v}_{ij} \times \nabla_{\mathbf{x}_{j}} W(\mathbf{x}_{i} - \mathbf{x}_{j}, h),
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{v}_{ij} = \mathbf{v}_{j} - \mathbf{v}_{i}$, and then by using the
vector $\mathbf{N} = \frac{\eta}{|\eta|}$, with $\eta = \nabla|\omega_{i}|$,
which will have a direction from areas with low vorticity towards areas
containing high vorticity. The resulting vorticity force is defined by

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Vorticity}
\mathbf{f}_{i_{vorticity}} = \varepsilon \left(\mathbf{N} \times \omega_{i} \right).
\end{equation}

The \textit{viscosity} is added to the velocity of the particles', the term
will control the fluid's consistency and is calculated as

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Viscosity}
\mathbf{v}_{i}^{new} = \mathbf{v}_{i} + c \sum\limits_{j} \mathbf{v}_{ij} \cdot W(\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{x}_j, h).
\end{equation}
